    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    // age2 stays the same because now age points to 200 but age2 was 
    // already assigned to point to 100
    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Jerry';
    // this changes the players array too because it's only changing reference
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // if slice is not given argument, returns a copy of the array
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team[1] = 'Maple';
    console.log(team2, team);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Jerry Lau',
      age: 23
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 30});
    console.log(captain, captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const captain3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    // shallow dup only goes one level deep, it doesn't deal with nested objects or arrays
    // quick way to do deep dup, translate json to string and then back to json
    JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
